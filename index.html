        <b>In <span id="next_year">...</span>, what will happen to the projects you're building today?</b>
        <br>
        Too often, the things we're proud of now are forgotten later.
        <br>
        Even our games are not built to be consumed more than once.
        <br>
        What if we could change that?
        <br>

      <p>
        <b>Timeless</b> is a new experiment by <a href="https://github.com/sporeball" target="_blank">@lux</a>.
        <br>
        The pitch? You have <b>10 days</b> to make a video game that could last someone <b>10 years.</b>
        <br>

        <summary>What?</summary>
        <div>
          <p>
            In 2021, I made a puzzle game called <a href="https://github.com/sporeball/myriad">Myriad</a>.
            <br>
            To play, you have to find a way to use 12 oddly shaped pieces to completely cover an 8x8 board.
            <br>
            There are 6,144 puzzles, and you get a new one every time you start the game.
          </p>
          <p>
            I still come back to this game every so often. I play it on flights, sometimes.
            <br>
            Despite that, after four years, <b>I still haven't solved a single puzzle.</b>
            <br>
            A devoted player &ndash; one who was better than me &ndash; could probably continue playing Myriad for 10 years before solving them all.
            <br>
            <b>This is the crux of Timeless.</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Expand upon the rules of an existing game.
            <br>
            Generate endless puzzles with code.
            <br>
            Or, make something that <b>has</b> to be played once a day.
            <br>
            Whatever you do, make sure it's something you could <b>keep coming back to again and again.</b>
