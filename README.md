# Timeless

Too often, the projects we build today are just forgotten later.\
What if we could change that?

**Timeless** is a new experiment by [@lux](https://github.com/sporeball).\
You have **10 days** to make a video game that could last someone **10 years**.\
If you do, we'll send you a paperback by [Boss Fight Books](https://bossfightbooks.com).

Timeless will run from **July 14** to **July 24**.\
Visit the [Timeless website](https://timeless.hackclub.com) to learn more and RSVP.
